# Interactive Rating Component
Design preview for the Interactive Rating Component

## Introduction
Welcome to my solution for the Interactive Rating Component challenge provided by Frontend Mentor. In this project, I've built an interactive rating component based on the provided design.

The challenge was to create a rating component that allows users to submit their feedback and see a "Thank you" message afterward. Users should also be able to view the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size and experience hover states for all interactive elements on the page.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features
- Users can select a rating from 1 to 5.
- Upon submission, users receive a "Thank you" message.
- The layout is responsive and adjusts based on the device's screen size.
- Hover states are implemented for interactive elements.
- Design
- The design files provided in the /design folder were used as a reference to create the layout and styling - for the rating component. The project aimed to match the design as closely as possible while ensuring responsiveness across different screen sizes.
